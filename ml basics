Why Machine Learning Matters

Reduces human effort in repetitive tasks

Makes accurate predictions for better decisions

Learns and improves with time

Saves money and increases efficiency in industries

Powers the technology people use every day
Artificial Intelligence (AI): The broad goal of making machines intelligent.

Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI that learns patterns from data.

Deep Learning (DL): A special kind of ML that uses neural networks, useful for images, speech, and natural language.
Types of Machine Learning

Supervised Learning: Learns from labeled data (with answers). Example: Predicting exam results from study hours.

Unsupervised Learning: Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data. Example: Grouping shoppers by buying behavior.

Reinforcement Learning: Learns by rewards and punishments. Example: Robots learning to walk or play chess.

Semi-supervised Learning: Uses a mix of labeled and unlabeled data.

Self-supervised Learning: A modern method used in large AI models like GPT.

Workflow of a Machine Learning Project

Define the problem

Collect data

Clean and preprocess data

Feature engineering (choosing right factors)

Split data into training, testing, validation sets

Train the model

Evaluate performance

Tune hyperparameters (settings)

Deploy into real systems

Monitor and update regularly
