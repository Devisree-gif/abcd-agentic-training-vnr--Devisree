What is Machine Learning (ML) and Why It Matters

Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed.

It differs from traditional programming, where rules are manually defined. In ML, the system derives rules from data.

Real-world use cases: recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon), image recognition (facial recognition, medical imaging), spam detection, predictive analytics (stock market, weather forecasting).

2. AI, ML, and Deep Learning — Relationship

Artificial Intelligence (AI): Broad field focused on building systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence.

Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI that learns from data.

Deep Learning (DL): A subset of ML that uses multi-layered neural networks to process complex data like images, speech, and text.

3. Types / Paradigms of Machine Learning

Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data (input → output).

Examples: classification, regression.

Unsupervised Learning: Learning patterns from unlabeled data.

Examples: clustering, dimensionality reduction.

Reinforcement Learning: An agent learns by interacting with the environment, receiving rewards or penalties.

Other types: Semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning.
